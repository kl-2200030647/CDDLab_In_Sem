Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate efficiently, and maintain different versions of their projects. It is widely used in software development for managing source code, ensuring code integrity, and enabling teamwork through branching and merging. GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based hosting service that leverages Git to provide a centralized location for storing and sharing repositories. Developers can use GitHub to collaborate on projects, contribute to open-source initiatives, and deploy applications seamlessly. By integrating Git with GitHub, teams can maintain a structured workflow, track issues, and automate deployments, making the development process more efficient.

Deploying a project to GitHub via Git Bash involves several key steps, including initializing a repository, adding and committing files, and pushing the code to a remote repository. This process allows developers to maintain a history of changes and share their work with others easily.
